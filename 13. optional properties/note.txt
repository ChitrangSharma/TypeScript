We can make a certain property optional in an object type by adding a question mark (?) after the property name.

For example, let's say you have an object type for a person with name, age, and email properties, but you want to make the email optional. 
You can do this by adding a question mark after the email property.

///Example////

type Person = {
    name:string,
    age:number,
    email?:string
}

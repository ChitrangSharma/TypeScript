TypeScript has a special type called = "ANY" the any type is something that can be used to represent any type. 
When a variable is annotated with the any type, TypeScript will allow it to have any value and disable all type checking for that variable and its properties.

Any type is not very much favoured by developers because we are forcing typescript to work as a javascript and drop the type safety, which we wanted from the typescript at the first place.

///WARNING///

While the any type can be useful in certain situations, it should be used sparingly. Overuse of any can lead to untyped code and make it hard to catch type-related bugs during development. 
It's generally better to use more specific types whenever possible to get the benifits of TypeScript's type checking.

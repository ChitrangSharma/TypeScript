Arrays are type of object that can store multiple values of the same data type.
Array in TypeScript are typed, which means you can specify the type of values that an array can hold

////NOTE////

There are two syntaxes or ways of creating an array in TypeScript
1. Using the square brackets notation [] to indicate an array of specific type.

2. Using the generic Array<type> notation to indicate an array of a specific type. (old syntax not much in use)
